# Guidelines
- Code should be tiny, clean, minimal, with structure and design that's easy for others to understand.
- Favor simple solutions when possible, avoid trying to be overly clever, solving for or guarding for hypothetical scenarios that don't exist.
- This is not an enterprise codebase, do not add standard boilerplate or other bloated code when it's not needed.
- Functionality should be well organized and componentized, without adding bloat. For example, clean minimal reusable components or functions.
- We want solid foundations. Always do the implementation that achieves the best end state in terms of tech design, code, and implementation patterns that are clean, consistent, elegant, and tiny, while achieving the goal. Don't just find the shortest way to do something if it's dirty or hacky.
- If the current implementation is poorly designed, hacky, bloated, or inconsistent, flag this and suggest improvements to achieve a clean and consistent end state. Don't just blindly add to bad implementation.
- Do not write useless wrapper functions that do almost nothing.
- Do not one-shot a lot of code at once. Work step by step in logical methodical chunks.
- Keep folder and file structure and naming as simple and tiny and minimal possible. File names lower case by default. Keep module and function naming simple and direct.
- For key functionality, make sure to write tiny minimal tests to validate implementation is correct. Test real functionality, not faked/mocked to just pass a test.
- For specific frameworks or libraries, your knowledge on the functions or usage patterns may be out of date. Reference latest docs or ask me for docs if unsure.
- When fixing issues or bugs, always methodically identify the root cause first, do not fix without checking in with me and confirming a root cause.
