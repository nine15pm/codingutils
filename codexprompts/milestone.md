description: plan tech design for milestone and break down tasks
argument-hint: [MILESTONE="<milestone>"]

Here is where we are in the project and what we are planning out:

$MILESTONE

Understand the current state of the project, think through the specs/requirements, and identify the key technical design decisions that need to be made to accomplish this milestone. If there are options, present them succinctly and I will decide. Then, break down the milestone into succinct and concrete tasks in an order that makes logical sense to build up the project incrementally and achieve the milestone. Do not over index on hypothetical or unknown details in the tasks as these should be left up to the eng who is implementing, focus on the key outcome or thing to accomplish in each task.
