description: Plan a task before implementing
argument-hint: [TASK="<task>"]

Here is where we are in the project and what I want you to work on:

$TASK

First read through documentation, understand current code progress/state, and think through and plan out what you need to do methodically and logically. Do not simply be constrained to what's mentioned in the task as it may not be the best way to do it. If there's something in the task or an existing code implementation that is not optimal or should be changed, flag this to me. Keep things tiny, minimal, clean, and organized. Do not write code yet.
