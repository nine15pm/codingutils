# COMMON
## Plan task
We are working on Milestone 8 in project.md. The team is working on tasks in parallel. I want you to work on the 1st task. First read through the documentation and understand what we are trying to accomplish, understand current code progress/state, and think through the tech design approaches, and plan out what you need to do methodically and logically. If there's something in the task or an existing code implementation that is not optimal, an issue, or should be changed, flag this to me. Ensure your planned approach is absolutely clean, elegant, consistent patterns, tiny, organized, and not hacky. Do not write code yet.

## Start task
Go ahead with the first task. Go step by step in logical pieces, do not one-shot a lot of code at once. Check back after completing the task. Ensure that your implementation is clean, correct, consistent, organized, not hacky/bloated, and ideally tiny.

## Review implementation
We're doing [X]. This will follow the spec in [X]. An eng just implemented. Review the code and flag if there are any errors or issues so far. The goal is clean elegant tech design, correct logic, simple and tiny where possible, and not hacky/bloated at all.

## Rewrite/refactor
We're in the process of a poker system from scratch rewrite to make it clean, correct, simple, and elegant patterns, no bloat or dirty hacky stuff. Read and follow the spec in pokerrefactor.md. We are scrapping the existing PokerManager, it's bloated and incorrect, ignore it. We are going entirely from scratch, implementing based on the spec. Nothing is sacred, we can change or delete or completely do from scratch any part of the game's code, whatever is needed for the cleanest, most consistent, end state. Additionally, I don't want you to optimize for tests passing at all right now. In fact, we have deleted the old PokerManager tests. We are using pokerrefactor_execution.md as a light execution tracker. We have completed the first 4 tasks in Chunk 1. Understand what you need to do for the next task in Chunk 1, then check in with me before starting. If there's something in the task definition or ordering that is not optimal, don't be constrained by it, flag it to me. If you see an error or issue with the spec or existing code, flag this to me. Don't write any code yet.

## Reflect on preferences
Based on our conversation so far, are there any clear high-signal general preferences (not specific to this task or project) you can infer from our interactions that would be beneficial to call out for future coding agents? E.g. from what I've said, emphasized, asked, liked vs. seemed frustrated by, etc. If so, add succinct bullets in PREFERENCES.md to reflect these preferences in simple direct language, in a way that will get future LLM agents to behave more in line with my preferences. Don't add duplicative preferences. You can edit/update existing preferences if you have high confidence, but do not delete preferences.
